###  Predict emails  spam  or ham  

This dataset is designed for building and evaluating machine learning models that classify emails as either spam (unwanted or malicious messages) or ham (legitimate messages). It provides a balanced corpus of labeled email messages suitable for natural language processing (NLP) and binary classification tasks.

## About the Project üíª
This project detects whether emails are Spam or Ham using machine learning classification algorithms. then trains various classification models to accurately identify unwanted (spam) versus legitimate (ham) messages. The goal is to build an efficient and reliable spam filter that can be used in real-world applications like email services or messaging platforms.

**Key components of this project include:**
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization.
- Feature engineering to create meaningful features.
- Model selection and training (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.).

## Project Workflow üìö

The project follows a structured workflow:

1. **Data Collection and Overview:** Load the Spam dataset and inspect its structure and content.

2. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:** Handle missing values, outliers, and encode categorical variables.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize and understand relationships between variables.

4. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features like  len of word , and num word 

5. **Model Selection and Training:** Train different models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.

6. **Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics:** Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and perform hyperparameter tuning.

7. **Conclusion and Results:** Summarize findings and identify impactful features and best-performing models.
